Creamy, hearty, and flavorful, this Potato Bacon Soup is perfect for lunch or dinner on a cold day.
Ingredients

- 8 slices bacon chopped
- ½ onion diced
- 2 cloves garlic minced
- 2 ribs celery diced
- 3 cups chicken broth low sodium
- 16 ounces baking potatoes peeled and diced ½", about 2 medium potatoes
- ¼ teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- salt & pepper to taste
- cayenne pinch
- parmesan cheese & sliced green onions for garnish

Instructions
- Cook bacon in a large saucepan over medium heat until crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.
- Add onion, garlic, and celery to the bacon fat and cook 3-4 minutes or until onion softens slightly.
- Stir in chicken broth, potatoes, and thyme. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer and cook covered 10 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Stir in cream and simmer for 5 minutes longer.
- Combine cornstarch and 1 tablespoon of water to create a slurry. Whisk into the simmering soup and simmer 1 minute. Stir in half of the bacon. Season with salt, pepper, and cayenne to taste.
- Spoon into bowls, top with parmesan cheese, remaining bacon and green onions.

Notes
- To make prep quick: Chop the onions & celery while the bacon is cooking. While the onion is cooking, peel and dice the potatoes.
- For a thicker soup, mash or blend a portion (or all) of the soup before adding the bacon.
- If using a thin skinned potato (red or Yukon gold) you can leave some of the peels on the potatoes for a rustic look and a bit more fiber.
- Cheddar cheese is a great addition to this soup. Stir in some of the bacon for flavor but reserve some for the top so it stays nice and crispy.
