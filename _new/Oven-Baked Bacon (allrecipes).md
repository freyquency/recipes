- Prep Time: 5 mins
- Cook Time: 30 mins
- Total Time: 35 mins
- Ingredients
- 1 (16 ounce) package bacon

Directions
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Place bacon slices, one next to the other, on the prepared baking sheet.
- Bake in the preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes.
- Remove from the oven to flip bacon slices with kitchen tongs and then return to the oven.
- Bake until crispy, 15 to 20 minutes more. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels.

Cook's Notes:
- Thinner slices will need less time, about 20 minutes total. 
- If you are making a lot of bacon, the bacon slices can slightly overlap, as the bacon will shrink when baking.
- Pour the bacon grease into a jar and allow to cool. Store in the fridge and use instead of oil.
