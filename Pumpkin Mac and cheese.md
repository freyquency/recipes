Prep Time:

Ingredients
============================
* 8oz dry macaroni pasta (I used tri-colour vegetable pasta)
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 large onion, thinly sliced
* 1 apple, diced (I used Red Delicious)
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1-1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 1/2 cup pumpkin beer
* 1 tablespoon pure maple syrup
* 1/2 cup evaporated 2% milk (regular 2% milk would work too)
* 1/2 teaspoon mustard powder
* 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
* Salt and pepper
* 1 cup pumpkin puree
* 1-1/4 cups grated sharp cheddar cheese (I used applewood smoked cheddar and I used 1-1/2 cups to use it up)
* ~1/4 cup panko bread crumbs, optional

Directions
============================
Preheat oven to 350°F.

Cook pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water, according to package directions.  Drain and set aside.

Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add onions, stir to coat with oil, and let cook, stirring occasionally, about ten minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Let cook another 5 minutes or so and then add the chopped apples.  Continue to cook apples and onions, stirring occasionally, for an additional 15 minutes or so, until onions are caramelized and apples are softened and golden brown.  Set aside.

About ten minutes before your onions and apples are done cooking, you can start the roux.  Add butter to a medium saucepan and let melt over medium heat.  Add flour to the melted butter and whisk continuously for about a minute. Raise heat a bit and add the beer.  Reduce until almost evaporated and mixture is quite thick, then whisk in the maple syrup and milk.  Season with mustard powder, nutmeg, and salt and pepper.  Let cook until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.  Whisk in the pumpkin then whisk in the grated cheese until incorporated.

Stir together the pasta, cheese sauce, onions, and apples.  At this point, you can serve the mac and cheese as is for a stovetop version, or you can bake it.  If you choose to bake it, spread it into an 8x8 glass baking dish and sprinkle breadcrumbs on top.  Bake in preheated oven for about 30 minutes, let cool slightly, then serve.
