Black Bean Burgers
============================
Source: Veganomicon
Servings/Yield: 6
Prep Time: 30 minutes

Ingredients
============================
  * 2 cups cooled or 1 (15 oz) can black beans, drained and rinsed
  * 1/2 cup vital wheat gluten
  * 1/2 cup plain whole wheat bread crumbs
  * 1 teaspoon chile powder
  * 1/2 teaspoon cumin
  * 1/4 cup water
  * 1 tablespoon tomato paste (or ketchup)
  * 1/4 cup finely chopped cilantro (optional)
  * 2 cloves garlic
  * 1/2 small onion
  * About 2 tablespoons of olive oil plus olive oil spray
  * Whole wheat buns

Directions
============================
Mash the beans with a fork in a mixing bowl. You don't want to puree them; just get them mashed so that no whole beans are left, but you should leave some half beans.

Add the vital wheat gluten, bread crumbs, chile powder, cumin, water, and tomato paste (and cilantro, if using), but don't mix yet. Use a microplane grater to grate the garlic in. (A garlic press or very well minced garlic works, too.) Use the large holes on a box grater to grate in the onion.

Mix everything together with a fork, and then proceed to knead with your hands, until the mixture is firm and uniformly mixed (about a minute).

Preheat a heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat.

Divide the burger mixture into six equal pieces. Roll each piece into a firm ball. Use your palm to press the ball down on a clean surface to form a patty that is about 1 1/2 inch thick. Press so the patty is flat on both sides. Makes six patties.

Pour a thin layer of olive oil into the pan. Cool the patties three at a time for 5 minutes on each side, gently but firmly pressing down on them with a spatula. Spray with olive oil before turning over, for uniform browning. Once cooked, the patties should be very firm when you press down on them.

Serve warm on burger buns.

Notes
============================

Freeze instructions: Once cooked, pack them in a resealable plastic back with sheets of waxed paper to separate them, then reheat in the oven at 350ºF for about 25 to 30 minutes.
